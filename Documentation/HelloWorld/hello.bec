main {
    write "Hello world" endLine
    exitCode
}

//Explanation:
//  main block  -> the entry block of the program, shortened int main(int argc, char* argv[])
//  write       -> writes text to the console, same as std::cout << but easier 
//  endLine     -> ends line of console text, same as << std::endl but easier
//  exitCode    -> tells the main block to exit the code, same as return 0
