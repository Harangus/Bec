In bec you can use all c++ operators, but there are some that are renamed for simplicity for beginners
-> is - equality check, condition example: if a is b 
-> !is - nonequality check, condition example: if a !is b
-> other - >, <, >=, <=, thats just classic
-> AND - and operator, same as && in c++
-> OR - or operator, same as || in c++
-> add - adds value to value, same as += in c++.
-> take - takes value from value, same as -= in c++
